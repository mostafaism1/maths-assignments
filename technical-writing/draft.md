Formal verification studies techniques for proving program correctness.
This is useful for discovering program errors and is especially crucial for critical programs such as in Avionics, Medical Devices, and Military Weaponry.

Static code analysis is one of the major techniques employed in formal verification, it works by scanning the source code along with meta-data that describe invariants in the program and then tries to prove that these invariants statically without running the program.
