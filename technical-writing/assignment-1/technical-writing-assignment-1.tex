\section*{A}
My name is Mostafa Hassanein. I'm a Software Engineer currently working at Telecom Systems Solutions, or TSS for short . At my company, I work on developing software products tailored for the telecom industry. Our products are used by both telecom operators and regulators to automate their processes and ensure they follow a valid and well-defined procedure. My background is in Mechanical Engineering and I am currently studying towards a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics.


\section*{B}
My field of research is Theoretical Computer Science, specifically: Programming Languages Design and Implementation. This area is very exciting because in Computer Science we think and conceive of problems and solutions in terms of the abstractions provided by the programming language, and the ability to design new languages helps us to tackle complex problems by providing higher-level abstractions that are more appropriate for viewing the problem and the solution.
