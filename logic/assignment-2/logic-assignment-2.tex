\section*{2-3}

To prove an implication we assume the antecedent and show that the consequent holds.

\subsection*{a.}
\begin{proof}
  $ $

  Let $T_3 = T_1 \cup T_2$.

  Suppose all WFFs in $T_3$ are true, then all WFFs in $T_1$, and $T_2$ are also true.

  From $T_1 \models \phi$, we conclude that $\phi$ is true.

  From $T_2 \models \psi$, we conclude that $\psi$ is true.

  Putting it all together, we get: $T_3 \models \phi \land \psi$.

\end{proof}

\subsection*{b.}
\begin{proof}
  $ $

  Let $T_4 = T_1 \cup T_2 \cup T_3$.

  Suppose all WFFs in $T_4$ are true, then all WFFs in $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$ are true.
  
  From $T_1 \models \phi$, we conclude that $\phi \lor \psi$ is true. We have 3 cases:
  \newline

  \underline{1. $\phi = \top \text{ and } \psi = \bot$:}
  
  In this case, all WFFs in $T_2 \cup \{ \phi \}$ are true.
  
  From $T_2 \cup \{ \phi \} \models \zeta$, we conclude that $\zeta$ is true.
  \newline

  \underline{2. $\phi = \bot \text{ and } \psi = \top$:}
  
  In this case, all WFFs in $T_3 \cup \{ \psi \}$ are true.
  
  From $T_3 \cup \{ \psi \} \models \zeta$, we conclude that $\zeta$ is true.
  \newline

  \underline{3. $\phi = \top \text{ and } \psi = \top$:}
  
  Using either case 1 or 2, it is clear that $\zeta$ is true.
  \newline

  Therefore, we conclude that $T_4 = T_1 \cup T_2 \cup T_3 \models \zeta$.  

\end{proof}

\subsection*{c.}
\begin{proof}
  $ $

  We want to show that $T_1 \models (\phi \implies \psi)$ is true, so we assume $T_1$ and attempt to show that $\phi \implies \psi$ holds.

  Next, to show that $\phi \implies \psi$, we assume $\phi$ and attempt to show that $\psi$ holds.

  Putting our assumptions together: $T_1$ and $\phi$ are true. Therefore, all WFFs in $T_1 \cup \{ \phi \}$ are true.

  From $T_1 \cup \{ \phi \} \models \psi$, we conclude that $\psi$ is true.

  Therefore, $T_1 \models (\phi \implies \psi)$ as desired.

\end{proof}

\subsection*{d.}
\begin{proof}(By Contradiction)
  $ $

  Suppose $T_1 \cup T_2$ is true.

  For the sake of contradiction, suppose that $\phi$ is true.

  From $T_1 \cup \{ \phi \} \models \psi$, we conclude that $\psi$ is true.

  From $T_2 \cup \{ \phi \} \models \lnot \psi$, we conclude that $\lnot \psi$ is true.

  But then we have: $\psi \land \lnot \psi$ is true. This is a contradiction.

  Therefore, we must conclude that: $T_1 \cup T_2 \models \lnot \phi$.

\end{proof}
